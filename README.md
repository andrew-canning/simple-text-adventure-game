Simple python text adventure game I wrote in a day for school

**Prompt**:
The point of the game is to go from room to room and do all the chores before reaching the master bedroom to please your 
wife that is tired of you skipping out on doing the house chores! 

If you try to go to the master bedroom before finishing the your chores you are sleeping on the bed for the night!

**Features**: The interesting part of the game is that it can randomly create the layout of the map.  Right now its
placement algorithm is very simple and could be improved.
